Description:
    Project 3 will go through the same steps as project 2 with pass one, but will also complete pass 2 of the project. This means that the program will find the opcode values and create the list and object files with them.

Extra Credit:
    I did not attempt the extra credit.

Experience:
    This felt like the hardest project of the semester. Pass 2 seemed to be a bit confusing and working with so many numbers made it difficult. I had issues with my object file for a few days but understood my errors and was able to correct them. Following the professor's 
    directions made the project simple but at the same time allowed me to mindlessly write code, which created issues with my values. I spent a lot of time debugging my code to figure out why my values were not correct.

Shortcomings:
    No shortcomings

Improvements:
    I do not like writing so many if / else statements and felt like I could of solved that issue with more time. I feel like I could clean the code up so more and possibly break chunks of code into smaller functions, but I did not do this.
