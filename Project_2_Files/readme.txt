Description:    
    This program will complete the first pass of the assembler. The program will take in the SIC file and create a symbol table with the correct symbol names and address. There is also a symbol table log to show which symbols are being added at which index of the table. This program will also detect if it is being passed in directives or opcodes to allocate the appropriate memory for each line in the SIC code. After the program runs through multiple tests it will add memory to the address and grab the appropriate symbol for the table. After the program is finished taking in the SIC file, it will show the user the table contents and finally an assembly summary showing the starting address, ending address, and size of the program in bytes.

Experience:
    The project was relatively simple after wrapping my head around the topics it covers. Until we worked on going through the process on paper in class I had a hard time understanding what the project was truly doing.
